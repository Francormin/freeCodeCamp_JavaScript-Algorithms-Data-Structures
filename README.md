<p>While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/" target="_blank">JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification</a>, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.</p>

<p>Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).</p>
